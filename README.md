# IconoParser
A GUI parser for converting the text from the game Iconoclasts into a human readable format and back again.

# How to use
Download built program from releases page. 
Run the program. Go to the game's directory (on Windows this is probably "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Iconoclasts\data\")
Drag-and-Drop a "dia" file from the directory into the main part of the window. Please note, only the file named "dia" is fully supported. I plan to add support for the other language files at a later time.*

Once dropped, the file will be automatically processed. You can then edit the file. Save your changes and then export the changed file.

After a few seconds, a file named "dia2" will be written to the directory from where you ran the program.

I recommend making a backup of the original "dia" file, or store the original in another directory. Then rename the "dia2" file to the name of the original "dia" file.

I've also included a video below.
